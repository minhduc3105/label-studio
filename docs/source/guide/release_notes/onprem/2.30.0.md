## Label Studio Enterprise 2.30.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">Databricks storage, Reviewer metrics, multiple UX enhancements</div>

*Oct 15, 2025*

Helm Chart version: [1.11.5](https://github.com/HumanSignal/charts/blob/master/heartex/label-studio/Chart.yaml)


### New features

#### Connect your Databricks files to Label Studio

There is a new cloud storage option to connect your Databricks Unity Catalog to Label Studio.

For more information, see [**Databricks Files (UC Volumes)**](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/storage#Databricks-Files-UC-Volumes).

Note that PDF import is not currently supported for Databricks source storage.

### Enhancements

#### Reviewer metrics

The [Annotator Performance Dashboard](dashboard_annotator) now includes two new graphs for Reviewer metrics:

You can also now find a **Review Time** column in the Data Manager:

!!! note
    Data collection for review time began on September 25, 2025. You cannot view time for reviewing activity that happened before data collection began. 
    
    Review time is measured in seconds.

#### Improved project Annotation settings

The **Annotation** section of the project settings has been improved.

- Clearer text and setting names
- When Manual distribution is selected, settings that only apply to Automatic distribution are hidden
- You can now preview instruction text and styling

For more information, see [Project settings - Annotation](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/project_settings_lse#Annotation).

#### Ground truth visibility in the agreement pop-up

When you click the **Agreement** column in the Data Manager, you can see a pop-up with an inter-annotator agreement matrix. This pop-up will now also identify annotations with ground truths.

For more information about adding ground truths, see [Ground truth annotations](ground_truths).

#### Sort video and audio regions by start time

You can now sort regions by media start time.

Previously you could sort by time, but this would reflect the time that the region was created. The new option reflects the start time in relation to the media.

<video style="max-width: 800px;" class="gif-border" autoplay loop muted>
  <source src="/images/releases/media-start-time-sort.mp4">
</video>


#### Support for latest Gemini models

When you add Gemini or Vertex AI models to Prompts or to the organization model provider list, you will now see the latest Gemini models.

**gemini-2.5-pro**

**gemini-2.5-flash**

**gemini-2.5-flash-lite**


#### JSON array input for the Table tag

Previously, the [Table tag](/tags/table) only accepted key/value pairs, for example:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "table_data": {
      "user": "123456",
      "nick_name": "Max Attack",
      "first": "Max",
      "last": "Opossom"
    }
  }
}
```

It will now accept an array of objects as well as arrays of primitives/mixed values. For example:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "table_data": [
      { "id": 1, "name": "Alice", "score": 87.5, "active": "true" },
      { "id": 2, "name": "Bob",  "score": 92.0, "active": "false" },
      { "id": 3, "name": "Cara", "score": null, "active": "true" }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Template search

You can now search the template gallery. You can search by template title, keywords, tag names, and more.

Note that template searches can only be performed if your organization has AI features enabled.

#### New parameters for the Video tag

The [Video tag](/tags/video) now has the following optional parameters:

- `defaultPlaybackSpeed` - The default playback speed when the video is loaded.
- `minPlaybackSpeed` - The minimum allowed playback speed.

The default value for both parameters is `1`.


### Miscellaneous UX improvements

- Owners and Admins will now see a shortcut from the Home page to the Annotator Performance Dashboard.

- On [images](/tags/image), the `smoothing` parameter is now automatically set to `false` by default when using with the [BitmaskLabels tag](/tags/bitmasklabels).


#### Multiple SDK enhancements

We have continued to add new endpoints to our SDK. See our [**SDK releases**](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio-sdk/releases).


#### Performance improvements and optimizations

Multiple performance optimizations for pages and actions.


### Breaking changes

Starting with this release, we will be using an [Alpine Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine). Previously we used Debian Trixie. 

If you build on top of our image, update your `FROM` line and replace `apt-get` with `apk`.
