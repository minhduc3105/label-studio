## Problem: Where Did My Agent Fail?

AI agent apps become hard to debug and improve as they grow more complex. Teams commonly struggle with:
- Too much complexity: RAG pipelines, LLM calls, and multi-step conversations make it hard to know where problems occur
- Getting stuck: After building prototypes, teams can't figure out what works, what breaks, or what to fix first
- Missing expertise: Engineers often don't have the domain knowledge needed to properly evaluate their app's performance

[The core activity proposed to address these issues is simply **"Look at your data"**.](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals-faq/)

However, who should look at the data is often unclear, yet this determines project success.

## Our Solution: Give it to your Domain Expert

We bridge this gap with a domain expert-centric UI that enables non-technical subject matter experts to systematically evaluate agent performance, complementing existing observability tools. This tutorial shows how to create an intuitive evaluation interface that transforms domain expertise into actionable improvements for your AI agents.


## Setup: Build Your Agent Evaluation Pipeline

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="https://hs-sandbox-pub.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blogs-draft/traces.jpg" alt="Agent evaluation pipeline overview" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px;">
</div>

This tutorial demonstrates a complementary pipeline design for AI agent evaluation:

**Step 1: Observability & Trace Collection**
- Use observability tools (like Langsmith in this demo) for trace storage and collection
- Engineer-centric interface for technical debugging and development iteration
- Captures detailed execution traces, timing, and system-level metrics
- Provides immediate feedback during development cycles

**Step 2: Expert-Centric Evaluation in Label Studio**
- Import traces from observability tools into Label Studio for human evaluation
- Expert-centric, multi-user collaborative platform designed for domain specialists
- Detailed UI for systematic assessment of each step in agentic workflows
- Enables domain experts (SMEs) to identify and annotate failure modes
- Supports team-based annotation workflows with inter-annotator agreement
- Quality control features including annotation review and consensus building
- Generates structured evaluation data for reports and LLM-as-a-Judge training

**Pipeline Benefits:**
- Engineers get technical observability while domain experts get intuitive evaluation tools
- Traces flow seamlessly from development (observability) to evaluation (Label Studio)
- Combines technical metrics with human domain expertise for comprehensive assessment
- Note: While we use Langsmith as our demo observability tool, this approach works with any trace collection system


```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

# Verify environment variables are loaded
required_vars = ['LANGSMITH_API_KEY', 'LANGSMITH_PROJECT', 'LABEL_STUDIO_URL', 'LABEL_STUDIO_API_KEY', 'OPENAI_API_KEY']
missing_vars = [var for var in required_vars if not os.getenv(var)]

if missing_vars:
    print(f"⚠️  Missing environment variables: {', '.join(missing_vars)}")
    print("Please configure these in your .env file before proceeding.")
else:
    print("✓ All environment variables loaded successfully")
```

    ✓ All environment variables loaded successfully


## 2. Running the Agent

We'll create a simple ReAct agent that can search academic papers on Arxiv.
This agent simulates a production use case where we help researchers find
relevant papers on specific topics.

The agent uses:
- **GPT-4o** as the reasoning engine
- **Arxiv tool** to search academic papers
- **LangSmith tracing** to capture all interactions automatically


```python
from langchain import hub
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_react_agent, load_tools
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
from uuid import uuid4

# Initialize LLM and Tools
llm = ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-4o')
tools = load_tools(["arxiv"])

# Pull the ReAct prompt template
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/react")

# Create the agent
agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(
    agent=agent,
    tools=tools,
    verbose=True,
    handle_parsing_errors=True,
)

print("✓ Agent initialized and ready")
```

    ✓ Agent initialized and ready


### Running Agent Examples

Let's simulate a user asking questions about latest research:


```python
questions = [
    "What is the latest research on Visual Language Models?",
    "Find papers about reinforcement learning in robotics from the last year",
    "Explain the latest innovations in transformer architectures based on recent papers"
]

for i, question in enumerate(questions, 1):
    config = RunnableConfig(run_id=str(uuid4()))
    result = agent_executor.invoke({"input": question}, config=config)

    print(f"\n✓ Run {i} completed. Run ID: {config.get('run_id')}")
    print(f"Question: {question}")
    print(f"Response: {result['output'][:200]}...")
```

    
```

    Action Input: "Visual Grounding Language Models 2023"[0m[36;1m[1;3mPublished: 2024-01-09
    Title: Expand BERT Representation with Visual Information via Grounded Language Learning with Multimodal Partial Alignment
    Authors: Cong-Duy Nguyen, The-Anh Vu-Le, Thong Nguyen, Tho Quan, Luu Anh Tuan
    Summary: Language models have been supervised with both language-only objective and
    visual grounding in existing studies of visual-grounded language learning.
    However, due to differences in the distribution and scale of visual-grounded
    datasets and language corpora, the language model tends to mix up the context
    of the tokens that occurred in the grounded data with those that do not. As a
    result, during representation learning, there is a mismatch between the visual
    information and the contextual meaning of the sentence. To overcome this
    limitation, we propose GroundedBERT - a grounded language learning method that
    enhances the BERT representation with visually grounded information.
    GroundedBERT comprises two components: (i) the original BERT which captures the
    contextual representation of words learned from the language corpora, and (ii)
    a visual grounding module which captures visual information learned from
    visual-grounded datasets. Moreover, we employ Optimal Transport (OT),
    specifically its partial variant, to solve the fractional alignment problem
    between the two modalities. Our proposed method significantly outperforms the
    baseline language models on various language tasks of the GLUE and SQuAD
    datasets.

    Title: Visually-Augmented Language Modeling
    Authors: Weizhi Wang, Li Dong, Hao Cheng, Haoyu Song, Xiaodong Liu, Xifeng Yan, Jianfeng Gao, Furu Wei
    Summary: Human language is grounded on multimodal knowledge including visual knowledge
    like colors, sizes, and shapes. However, current large-scale pre-trained
    language models rely on text-only self-supervised training with massive text
    data, which precludes them from utilizing relevant visual information when
    necessary. To address this, we propose a novel pre-training framework, named
    VaLM, to Visually-augment text tokens with retrieved relevant images for
    Language Modeling. Specifically, VaLM builds on a novel latent text-image
    alignment method via an image retrieval module to fetch corresponding images
    given a textual context. With the visually-augmented context, VaLM uses a
    visual knowledge fusion layer to enable multimodal grounded language modeling
    by attending to both text context and visual knowledge in images. We evaluate
    VaLM on various visual knowledge-intensive commonsense reasoning tasks, which
    require visual information to excel. The experimental results illustrate that
    VaLM outperforms all strong language-only and vision-language baselines with
    substantial gains in reasoning object commonsense including color, size, and
    shape. Our code is available at https://github.com/Victorwz/VaLM.

    Title: Like a bilingual baby: The advantage of visually grounding a bilingual language model
    Authors: Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Zixin Tang, Ankur Mali, Alex Kelly
    Summary: Unlike most neural language models, humans learn language in a rich,
    multi-sensory and, often, multi-lingual environment. Current language models
    typically fail to fully capture the complexities of multilingual language use.
    We train an LSTM language model on images and captions in English and Spanish
    from MS-COCO-ES. We find that the visual grounding improves the model's
    understanding of semantic similarity both within and across languages and
    improves perplexity. However, we find no significant advantage of visual
    grounding for abstract words. Our results provide additional evidence of the
    advantages of visually grounded language models and point to the need for more
    naturalistic language data from multilingual speakers and multilingual datasets
    with perceptual grounding.[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe latest research on Visual Language Models explores various methods to enhance and ground language models with visual information. Here are some recent developments:
    
    1. **GroundedBERT**: This study proposes a method to enhance BERT representations with visually grounded information. It combines BERT's contextual word representations with a visual grounding module that captures visual data. The approach uses Optimal Transport for partial alignment between these modalities and shows improved performance on language tasks compared to baseline models.
    
    2. **VaLM (Visually-Augmented Language Modeling)**: This framework augments text tokens with images retrieved based on the textual context to enrich language models with visual knowledge such as colors, sizes, and shapes. The visually augmented context is processed using a visual knowledge fusion layer. VaLM has shown substantial improvements in visual commonsense reasoning tasks over traditional language-only models and vision-language baselines.
    
    3. **Bilingual Language Modeling with Visual Grounding**: This research trains an LSTM model using bilingual (English and Spanish) datasets with visual grounding. It finds that visual grounding enhances the model's semantic understanding across languages and improves perplexity but does not significantly benefit the comprehension of abstract terms. This highlights the potential of visually grounded models but also their limitations with abstract language.
    
    These studies indicate ongoing efforts to integrate visual information into language models for improved performance in multimodal and multilingual contexts.[0mInvalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:'[32;1m[1;3mFinal Answer: The latest research in Visual Language Models includes several innovative approaches:
    
    1. **GroundedBERT**: This method enhances BERT with visually grounded information to improve the contextual understanding of text by addressing misalignments between text and visual data using Optimal Transport. It has shown superior performance on language tasks like GLUE and SQuAD.
    
    2. **VaLM (Visually-Augmented Language Modeling)**: VaLM incorporates visual information by augmenting text with context-relevant images, using a visual knowledge fusion layer. It has demonstrated improved performance in visual commonsense reasoning tasks, surpassing both language-only and vision-language models.
    
    3. **Bilingual Language Modeling with Visual Grounding**: This research employs visual grounding in bilingual (English-Spanish) language models to enhance semantic similarity understanding across languages, although it shows less impact on abstract concepts. It underscores the benefits and limitations of using visual data in multilingual contexts. 
    
    These studies illustrate the significant impact of integrating visual information into language models, optimizing them for varied and complex tasks by providing them with additional contextual data from images.[0m

    Title: A Concise Introduction to Reinforcement Learning in Robotics
    Authors: Akash Nagaraj, Mukund Sood, Bhagya M Patil
    Summary: One of the biggest hurdles robotics faces is the facet of sophisticated and
    hard-to-engineer behaviors. Reinforcement learning offers a set of tools, and a
    framework to address this problem. In parallel, the misgivings of robotics
    offer a solid testing ground and evaluation metric for advancements in
    reinforcement learning. The two disciplines go hand-in-hand, much like the
    fields of Mathematics and Physics. By means of this survey paper, we aim to
    invigorate links between the research communities of the two disciplines by
    focusing on the work done in reinforcement learning for locomotive and control
    aspects of robotics. Additionally, we aim to highlight not only the notable
    successes but also the key challenges of the application of Reinforcement
    Learning in Robotics. This paper aims to serve as a reference guide for
    researchers in reinforcement learning applied to the field of robotics. The
    literature survey is at a fairly introductory level, aimed at aspiring
    researchers. Appropriately, we have covered the most essential concepts
    required for research in the field of reinforcement learning, with robotics in
    mind. Through a thorough analysis of this problem, we are able to manifest how
    reinforcement learning could be applied profitably, and also focus on
    open-ended questions, as well as the potential for future research.

    Title: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Strategy for UAV Autonomous Landing on a Platform
    Authors: Z. Jiang, G. Song
    Summary: With the development of industry, drones are appearing in various field. In
    recent years, deep reinforcement learning has made impressive gains in games,
    and we are committed to applying deep reinforcement learning algorithms to the
    field of robotics, moving reinforcement learning algorithms from game scenarios
    to real-world application scenarios. We are inspired by the LunarLander of
    OpenAI Gym, we decided to make a bold attempt in the field of reinforcement
    learning to control drones. At present, there is still a lack of work applying
    reinforcement learning algorithms to robot control, the physical simulation
    platform related to robot control is only suitable for the verification of
    classical algorithms, and is not suitable for accessing reinforcement learning
    algorithms for the training. In this paper, we will face this problem, bridging
    the gap between physical simulation platforms and intelligent agent, connecting
    intelligent agents to a physical simulation platform, allowing agents to learn
    and complete drone flight tasks in a simulator that approximates the real
    world. We proposed a reinforcement learning framework based on Gazebo that is a
    kind of physical simulation platform (ROS-RL), and used three continuous action
    space reinforcement learning algorithms in the framework to dealing with the
    problem of autonomous landing of drones. Experiments show the effectiveness of
    the algorithm, the task of autonomous landing of drones based on reinforcement
    learning achieved full success.

    Summary: We address adversarial attacks on the actuators at the joints of legged
    robots trained by deep reinforcement learning. The vulnerability to the joint
    attacks can significantly impact the safety and robustness of legged robots. In
    this study, we demonstrate that the adversarial perturbations to the torque
    control signals of the actuators can significantly reduce the rewards and cause
    walking instability in robots. To find the adversarial torque perturbations, we
    develop black-box adversarial attacks, where, the adversary cannot access the
    neural networks trained by deep reinforcement learning. The black box attack
    can be applied to legged robots regardless of the architecture and algorithms
    of deep r[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe search returned relevant papers on reinforcement learning in robotics, published within the last year. Here are the details of the papers identified:

    Title: Transforming ECG Diagnosis:An In-depth Review of Transformer-based DeepLearning Models in Cardiovascular Disease Detection
    Authors: Zibin Zhao
    Summary: The emergence of deep learning has significantly enhanced the analysis of
    electrocardiograms (ECGs), a non-invasive method that is essential for
    assessing heart health. Despite the complexity of ECG interpretation, advanced
    deep learning models outperform traditional methods. However, the increasing
    complexity of ECG data and the need for real-time and accurate diagnosis
    necessitate exploring more robust architectures, such as transformers. Here, we
    present an in-depth review of transformer architectures that are applied to ECG
    classification. Originally developed for natural language processing, these
    models capture complex temporal relationships in ECG signals that other models
    might overlook. We conducted an extensive search of the latest
    transformer-based models and summarize them to discuss the advances and
    challenges in their application and suggest potential future improvements. This
    review serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners and aims
    to shed light on this innovative application in ECG interpretation.

    Title: Edge-MoE: Memory-Efficient Multi-Task Vision Transformer Architecture with Task-level Sparsity via Mixture-of-Experts
    Authors: Rishov Sarkar, Hanxue Liang, Zhiwen Fan, Zhangyang Wang, Cong Hao
    Summary: Computer vision researchers are embracing two promising paradigms: Vision
    Transformers (ViTs) and Multi-task Learning (MTL), which both show great
    performance but are computation-intensive, given the quadratic complexity of
    self-attention in ViT and the need to activate an entire large MTL model for
    one task. M$^3$ViT is the latest multi-task ViT model that introduces
    mixture-of-experts (MoE), where only a small portion of subnetworks ("experts")
    are sparsely and dynamically activated based on the current task. M$^3$ViT
    achieves better accuracy and over 80% computation reduction but leaves
    challenges for efficient deployment on FPGA.
      Our work, dubbed Edge-MoE, solves the challenges to introduce the first
    end-to-end FPGA accelerator for multi-task ViT with a collection of
    architectural innovations, including (1) a novel reordering mechanism for
    self-attention, which requires only constant bandwidth regardless of the target
    parallelism; (2) a fast single-pass softmax approximation; (3) an accurate and
    low-cost GELU approximation; (4) a unified and flexible computing unit that is
    shared by almost all computational layers to maximally reduce resource usage;
    and (5) uniquely for M$^3$ViT, a novel patch reordering method to eliminate

## 3. Collecting Traces

Now that we've generated several agent interactions, we'll:
1. Connect to LangSmith and [query Agent traces](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/export-traces)
2. Filter for relevant run types (AgentExecutor, LLM, Tool, Retriever)
3. Convert traces to [Label Studio format with predictions](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/predictions)


```python
from langsmith import Client
import json
from datetime import datetime
import uuid
import random
import string

# Initialize Langsmith client
client = Client()

# Define filter to get relevant run types
# We want to capture the complete agent execution flow
filter_string = 'or(and(eq(name, "AgentExecutor"), eq(run_type, "chain")), eq(run_type, "llm"), eq(run_type, "tool"), eq(run_type, "retriever"))'

# Fetch all runs from the project
runs = client.list_runs(
    project_name=os.getenv('LANGSMITH_PROJECT'),
    filter=filter_string
)

# Sort runs by start_time for chronological processing
runs = sorted(runs, key=lambda run: run.start_time)

# Group runs by trace_id
traces = {}
for run in runs:
    if run.trace_id not in traces:
        traces[run.trace_id] = []
    traces[run.trace_id].append(run.dict())

print(f"✓ Collected {len(traces)} traces from Langsmith")
print(f"  Total runs: {len(runs)}")
```

    ✓ Collected 24 traces from Langsmith
      Total runs: 149


### 4. Handler Functions for Different Run Types

These functions convert different types of Langsmith runs into Label Studio's
chat message format. Each run type has specific data structures that need to be
transformed appropriately.


```python
# Agent requests LLM provider
AGENT_LLM_CALL = 'agent_llm_call'
# Agent receives response from LLM provider
AGENT_LLM_RESPONSE = 'agent_llm_response'
# Agent calls tool (e.g. API call)
AGENT_TOOL_CALL = 'agent_tool_call'
# Agent calls retriever
AGENT_RETRIEVER_CALL = 'agent_retriever_call'
```


```python

### 5. Convert Traces to Label Studio Format

This function transforms Langsmith traces into Label Studio's task format.
The `mode="predictions"` parameter creates pre-annotations that annotators
can review and modify, speeding up the evaluation process.

### Key Features:
- Preserves chronological order of agent interactions
- Maintains timestamps for temporal analysis
- Structures data to match [Label Studio's Chat interface](https://labelstud.io/tags/chat)
- Creates predictions for each message (except the initial user query)

## 6. Evaluate Traces

To run evaluation on the collected agent traces, use [Label Studio XML configuration](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/setup) to provide a specialized UI with:

- **Chat Display**: Shows the full conversation with all agent interactions
- **Message-Level Annotation**: Click any message to annotate specific errors
- **Role-Specific Error Categories**:
  - User errors (request issues)
  - Assistant errors (hallucination, bias, format, etc.)
  - Tool errors (tool malfunction or incorrect output)
- **Overall Assessment**: Rate the entire conversation
- **Notes Fields**: Capture detailed feedback from annotators

This configuration enables Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to perform detailed
failure mode analysis on each step of the agent's reasoning process.

### 7. Push Tasks to Label Studio

Now we'll create or update the Label Studio project and import all our traces.
The import process:

1. **Check for existing project**: If a project with the same name exists, we'll use it
2. **Create project if needed**: Set up a new project with our chat configuration
3. **Import tasks**: Upload all traces with predictions as pre-annotations
4. **Generate labeling link**: Provide direct access to the annotation interface

### Understanding Label Studio Import

When we import tasks with `predictions`, Label Studio creates pre-annotations
that appear in the labeling interface. This is powerful because:

- **Speeds up annotation**: Annotators see the full conversation immediately
- **Maintains context**: All agent steps are visible and evaluable
- **Enables comparison**: Multiple annotators can independently assess the same trace
- **Quality control**: Supports consensus-based evaluation workflows


```python
from label_studio_sdk.client import LabelStudio

# Initialize Label Studio client
ls = LabelStudio(
    base_url=os.getenv("LABEL_STUDIO_URL"),
    api_key=os.getenv("LABEL_STUDIO_API_KEY")
)

# Get or create project
project_name = os.getenv("LANGSMITH_PROJECT")
projects = list(ls.projects.list(title=project_name))

if len(projects) == 0:
    print(f"Creating new project: {project_name}")
    project_id = ls.projects.create(
        title=project_name,
        label_config=label_config
    ).id
else:
    print(f"Using existing project: {project_name}")
    project_id = projects[0].id

# Ensure project has correct label config
project = ls.projects.get(int(project_id))
if project.label_config.strip() == '<View></View>' or not project.label_config.strip():
    print("Updating project with chat configuration...")
    ls.projects.update(project_id, label_config=label_config)

# Import tasks
resp = ls.projects.import_tasks(project_id, request=tasks)
print(f"\n✓ Successfully imported {len(tasks)} tasks to Label Studio")
print(f'Go to: {os.getenv("LABEL_STUDIO_URL").rstrip("/")}/projects/{project_id}/data')

# Save tasks to file
with open('tasks.json', mode='w') as f:
    json.dump(tasks, f, indent=2)
```

### 8. Access the Labeling Interface

#### The Evaluation Workflow

Your traces are now ready for evaluation! The labeling interface provides:

##### For Each Message:
- Click any message to annotate errors specific to that step
- Select from predefined error categories (hallucination, format, bias, etc.)
- Add detailed notes explaining the issue

##### For Each Conversation:
- Overall assessment (Contains Errors / No Errors)
- General notes about the entire agent execution

##### Multi-User Collaboration:
- Multiple SMEs can annotate the same traces
- Compare annotations to measure inter-annotator agreement
- Use consensus to establish ground truth labels

#### Next Steps with Collected Data:

1. **Generate Reports**: [Analyze failure modes across all traces](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/quality)
2. **Design Prompts**: [Use annotated examples to improve agent instructions](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/prompts_overview)
3. **LLM-as-a-Judge**: [Create evaluation prompts based on SME feedback](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/prompts_predictions)
4. **Quality Metrics**: [Track error rates over time as you iterate](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/dashboards)
5. **Dataset Creation**: [Build high-quality datasets for fine-tuning](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/ml)


```python
# Generate the labeling URL
labeling_url = f"{os.getenv('LABEL_STUDIO_URL')}/projects/{project_id}/labeling"

print("\n" + "="*80)
print("🎉 SETUP COMPLETE!")
print("="*80)
print(f"\n📊 Project: {project_name}")
print(f"📝 Tasks imported: {resp.task_count}")
print(f"\n🔗 Start annotating:")
print(f"   {labeling_url}")
print("\n💡 Share this link with your Subject Matter Experts to begin evaluation")
print("\n" + "="*80)
```

## Summary

This tutorial demonstrated the complete workflow from agent execution to expert evaluation:

1. ✓ Set up environment with LangSmith and Label Studio
2. ✓ Ran a ReAct agent with Arxiv search capabilities
3. ✓ Collected traces automatically via LangSmith
4. ✓ Transformed traces into Label Studio's annotation format
5. ✓ Configured a specialized chat UI for failure mode analysis
6. ✓ Imported tasks with pre-annotations
7. ✓ Generated access link for SME annotation

### Key Takeaway

While LangSmith excels at technical debugging during development, Label Studio
provides the collaborative, expert-driven evaluation framework necessary for
production AI systems. The combination creates a powerful workflow:

- **Development**: Engineers use LangSmith for debugging
- **Evaluation**: SMEs use Label Studio for quality assessment
- **Iteration**: Insights from both feed back into agent improvements

Happy evaluating! 🚀
